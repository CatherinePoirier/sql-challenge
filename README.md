# sql-challenge
In this challange I used both Data Engineering and Data Analysis to complete the assignments.
The provided database talbes were analyzed to determine where the Primary Keys were and how the tables would connect via funtional keys.
A Diagram was drawn using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
See file "Employe Database Diagram.PNG" for the results

Next the data were creaed into SQL tables via pgAdmin. 
See HW_employee_DB.sql to see how this was done.

Then the below queries were created based on the questions asked.
See data nalysis.sql to run the queries to get the answers.
